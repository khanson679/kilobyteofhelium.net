I thought it might be fun to try blogging.

I was talking to a friend recently, and he vouched for the value of keeping a journal. I agreed with him. In fact, I was convinced of the value of journaling when I was 18. Many years later, I've never succeeded at making it a habit.

Blogging is something else I've never done. Maybe this will stick.

If you're wondering about the title, it's intended to be meaningless...mostly.

See you around!
