It was probably about 5 years ago that I learned about the Five Factor model of personality.
I'm sure it was mentioned in the intro psychology class that I took years earlier, but anyway this time it stuck.
And it completely changed how I think about people.
It's almost frightening how clearly you can see the five traits once you know what to look for.

It's pretty easy to find information on this subject, so I'll give just a brief overview.
No sources cited, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
I want to keep this blog casual, and give myself a break from the kind of writing I do for my job.
Onward!

# The lowdown

The five factors are as follows:
- Extroversion
- Conscientiousness
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism
- Openness

Each of these is a continuous variable -- you have some people that score very high, some that score very low, and everything in between.
Also, they are all normally distributed, so most people are somewhere in the middle range for each, with the extremes being comparatively rare.
Finally, they are mostly uncorrelated with each other.
This means that any particular individual might have any combination of values for each of the five factors.
So if you wanted to classify people into personality types, and divided each factor into just three levels (low, medium, and high), you would get 3^5, or 243 distinct personality types.

This seems about right to me.
It's hard to place people accurately into a small number of boxes, but at the same time they are not infinitely different from one another.
You can see recurring patterns.

Unlike some of the other schemes you may have heard of (such as the ever popular Myers-Briggs), the Five Factor model actually has a sound scientific basis.
Actually, it's pretty much the only game in town.
The research shows effect sizes larger than almost anything else in all of social science.

Without further ado, I'll describe what each end of the spectrum looks like for each trait, but it's important to remember that most people show a bit of each side.

# Extroversion

The fundamental characteristic of extroversion is *sensitivity to stimulation*.

Extroverts need a lot of stimulation.
This is why they are stereotypically adventurous, thrill-seeking, and above all, *sociable*.
Humans are social creatures, so social interaction is a particularly good way for extroverts to get their stimulation fix.

Introverts, naturally, are the opposite.
Introverts are strongly effected by external stimuli.
As a result, they don't need as much stimulation to reach a comfortable level, and can easily be pushed beyond this level.
This explains why introverts find social interaction tiring.
It's not that they don't need or like it (at least, not necessarily), it's that you can have too much of a good thing.

I am moderately introverted.
Occasionally I doubt this when I find myself having to take the lead in making small talk or inviting people to do things.
But social interaction *definitely* tires me out, which more or less cinches it.

# Conscientiousness

This is probably the most obvious of the five factors.
Conscientious people are neat, organized, and hard-working.
Unconscientious people are, well, not so much.

Each of the five factors actually has two semi-distinct subfactors, which are highly but not perfectly correlated with each other.
I forget what all 10 of the subfactors are, but the two subfactors of conscientiousness, orderliness and industriousness, are clear and memorable.

Orderliness includes the "neat and organized" part.
Orderly people notice things that are dirty, cluttered, or just wrong, and want to fix them.
The way this works is by threshold sensitivity -- a person scoring at level X for orderliness will notice and be bothered by things that for a person at level X+1 simply do not register at all.
Orderliness is also associated with disgust sensitivity, the main negative emotion that does not correlate with neuroticism.

Industriousness is the "hard-working" part.
Industrious people work at things diligently even if they are not enjoyable, even if they would rather be doing something else.
If an industrious person feels obligated to do something, they are not likely to half-ass it or quit.
Less industrious people, in comparison, are quicker to throw in the towel.

# Agreeableness

Agreeableness is basically niceness.

Agreeable people want to get along with others, and are concerned for their happiness and well-being.
The former means that they tend to be polite, and avoid "rocking the boat".
The latter leads to nurturing and self-sacrificing behavior, and being deeply invested in personal relationships.

Disagreeable people, in contrast, could care less what others think or feel.
This comes with all of the obvious advantages and disadvantages.

I think I'm fairly agreeable, though there's a bit of ambiguity on this one.
I can be very blunt, which is not supposed to be typical trait of agreeable people.
I have a theory for this, but it's too vague to try to explain here.

I think that agreeableness is most interesting in the way that it interacts with the other four traits, so I won't say any more for now.

# Neuroticism

Neuroticism is general sensitivity to negative emotions: sadness, anxiety, anger, guilt, etc.
Everything except for disgust, as mentioned earlier.
Neurotic people are more likely than non-neurotic to get upset when bad things happen, and to get *very* upset when *very* bad things happen.

It's a bit strange compared to the other traits, in that high neuroticism seems to be mostly a bad thing.
For example, high neuroticism is associated with risk of clinical anxiety and depression, which certainly seems maladaptive since these conditions generally make it *harder* to deal with one's problems.

As someone who is somewhat neurotic, I would speculate that the benefit of negative emotions is that they can serve as a wake-up call when things are amiss.
For example, I get pretty upset with myself when I think I screwed up somehow, more so when I *know* that I screwed up.
This is a pretty strong motivator to not make the same mistake again.
Life is probably easier for non-neurotic people, but there are probably downsides to being too happy-go-lucky as well.

# Openness

Openness includes both openness to ideas and openness to experience.

Open people are interested in learning and doing new things, including but not limited to creative pursuits like art and music.
What draws them in is not popularity or practicality, but the intrinsic fascination of the the thing itself.
They are also inclined to change their beliefs when presented with new information.

Non-open people are more comfortable with what they already know.
They are less likely to see the value in the new and different -- what's wrong with the way we've always done things?
They also tend to be resistant to changing their beliefs, even when presented with strong evidence.
Maybe they'll come around eventually, but maybe not.

As will probably come as no surprise, I'm very high in openness.
I'm doing a PhD after all -- it's kind of a prerequisite.

# Extroversion + Openness - Neuroticism = Adventurousness?

What's really cool about the Five Factor model is how you can derive various common personality types
