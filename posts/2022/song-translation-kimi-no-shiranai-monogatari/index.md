Title: Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari (The Story You Don't Know) <br/>
Lyrics/Composition: ryo <br/>
Performer: supercell

This is the ending song to the anime *Bakemonogatari*.
It's a real gem -- beautiful melody and lyrics, and adjusted an octave down it even fits my vocal range!
You can find it on Youtube.

I often find Japanese song lyrics difficult to understand.
There's a lot of ambiguity as to which lines go together in a way that can greatly change the interpretation, especially if you are not a native speaker.
This one, though, I think I basically understand, which is why I've decided to write it up first.

I provide only the romanization and translation below.
You can find the original Japanese [here](https://www.uta-net.com/song/82447/).
This translation is loose and not matched to the rhythm of the song.
Also, sorry about the weird formatting -- I'm using Markdown tables.

Japanese | English
--- | ---
Itsumodoori no aru hi no koto | On one completely ordinary day
Kimi wa totsuzen tachiagari itta | You suddenly stood up and said
"Konya hoshi wo mi ni ikou" | "Let's go stargazing tonight!"
|
"Tama ni wa ii koto iu n da ne" | "Every once in a while you have a good idea!"
Nante minna shite itte waratta | We all said laughing
Akari mo nai michi wo | As we gleefully trapsed down
Baka mitai ni hashaide aruita | An unlit road
Kakaekonda kodoku ya fuan ni | Trying to avoid being crushed
Oshitsubusarenai you ni | By the anxiety we felt
|
Makkura na sekai kara miageta | We looked up from the blackness
Yozora wa hoshi ga furu you de | And the stars looked as if they could fall from the sky
|
Itsu kara darou kimi no koto wo | How long has it been, I wonder
Oikakeru watashi ga ita | Since I've been chasing after you?
Dou ka onegai | Please, I beg you
Odorokanaide kiite yo | Don't freak out when I tell you
Watashi no kono omoi wo | How I feel about you
|
"Are ga Denebu, Arutairu, Bega" | "There's Deneb, Altair, Vega"
Kimi wa yubisasu natsu no daisankaku | I remember you pointing out
Oboete sora wo miru | The Summer Triangle
Yatto mitsuketa Orihime-sama | Look, I found Orihime!
Dakedo doko darou Hikoboshi-sama | But where's her Hikoboshi?
Kore ja hitori bocchi | They'll be lonely like this
|
Tanoshige na hitotsu tonari no kimi | Laying right beside your cheery self
Watashi wa nanimo ienakute | I couldn't utter a word
|
Hontou wa zutto kimi no koto wo | The truth is that somewhere deep down
Dokoka de wakatteita | I already knew how I felt about you
Mitsukattatte todoki wa shinai | But I couldn't say it
Dame da yo nakanaide | No, don't cry
Sou iikikaseta | I told myself
|
Tsuyogaru watashi wa okubyou de | I acted like a coward
Kyoumi ga nai you na furi wo shiteta | Pretending I had no interest in you
Dakedo | And yet
Mune wo sasu itami wa mashiteku | I felt a sharp pain in my chest
Aa sou ka suki ni naru tte | And I realized this is how it feels
Kou iu koto nan da ne | To fall in love
|
Dou shitai? Itte goran | Tell me, what do you want?
Kokoro no koe ga suru | My heart called out
Kimi no tonari ga ii | I want to be with you
Shinjitsu wa zankoku da | Reality is so cruel
|
Iwanakatta | I didn't say it
Ienakatta | I couldn't say it
Nido to modorenai | And now there's no going back
|
Ano natsu no hi | The summer night
Kirameku hoshi | The twinkling stars
Ima demo omoidaseru yo | I remember them even now
Waratta kao mo | I remember your smile
Okotta kao mo | And your frown
Daisuki deshita | I loved them both
Okashii yo ne | Isn't it strange?
Wakatteta no ni | Even though I knew
Kimi no shiranai | You never did know
Watashi dake no himitsu | My secret
Yoru wo koete | In a distant memory
Tooi omoide no kimi ga | From that night
Yubi wo sasu | You pointed to the sky
Mujaki na koe de | And started to say...
