I'd like to start the new year with another song translation.

This is the ending theme to the Miyazaki film "Spirited Away", and one of the first Japanese songs I learned.
It's somewhat melancholy, yet uplifting, and it's hard to convey just how simple yet beautiful the words are.

--- | ---
Yondeiru mune no dokoka oku de | My heart calls from deep within
Itsumo kokoro odoru yume o mitai | I want to dream the dreams that move my heart
Kanashimi wa kazoekirenai keredo | Though my sorrows cannot be numbered
Sono mukou de kitto anata ni aeru | I know that I'll meet you on the other side
|
Kurikaesu ayamachi no sonotabi hito wa | Each time people repeat mistakes
Tada aoi sora no aosa o shiru | They simply learn to see the blue sky
Hateshinaku michi wa tsuzuite mieru keredo | Though the road ahead appears endless
Kono ryoute wa hikari o idakeru | In these hands I can embrace the light
|
Sayonara no toki no shizuka na mune | In times of farewell my heart becomes quiet
Zero ni naru karada ga mimi o sumaseru | And my empty body begins to listen
Ikiteiru fushigi shinde yuku fushigi | The mystery of living -- the mystery of dying --
Hana mo kaze mo machi mo minna onaji | The flowers, wind, and towns are all just the same
|
Yondeiru mune no dokoka oku de | My heart calls from deep within
Itsumo nando demo yume o egakou | Always and forever I will dream my dreams
Kanashimi no kazu o iitsukusu yori | Rather than listing my sorrows
Onaji kuchibiru de sotto utaou | I will use my lips to sing
|
Tojite yuku omoide no sono naka ni itsumo | I always listen to those whispers
Wasuretakunai sasayaki o kiku | Of fading memories I wish not to forget
Konagona ni kudakareta kagami no ue ni mo | Upon the fragments of a shattered mirror
Atarashii keshiki ga utsusareru | There dances a new scene
|
Hajimari no asa no shizuka na mado | A quiet window in a morning of beginnings
Zero ni naru karada mitasarete yuke | Let my empty body be filled!
Umi no kanata ni wa mou sagasanai | I will no longer look beyond the sea
Kagayaku mono wa itsumo koko ni | For I've found my own light
Watashi no naka ni mitsukerareta kara | It's right here within me
